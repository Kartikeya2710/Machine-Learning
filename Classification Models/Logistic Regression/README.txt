### Logistic Regression Notes
I have added my hand-written notes on Logistic Regression covering the intuition and math behind the algorithm. I believe that these notes are sufficient for a beginner to get a good hold on the topic and implement the same from scratch.

### Implementation of Logistic Regression
I have implemented Logistic Regression with Batch Gradient Descent from scratch using Numpy and matplotlib on the Coronary Heart Disease dataset from Kaggle. I have also done some Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including some feature engineering, data observation and visualization.
